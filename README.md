# MorseCode-Translator
This Java program uses the Binary Tree Data Structure as a basis to convert Morse Code to English and vice-versa. 
Running the driver class generates a GUI in which the user can translate Strings from one nature to another. 
The user can enter strings manually, or read .txt files into the program to translate the desired text.
